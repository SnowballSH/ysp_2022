# YSP 2022

## Part of the things I learned from the 2022 UChicago YSP 9/10 math program. The topic was Number Theory and is extracted from a university-level "Introduction to Number Theory" course.

### I wrote many theorems and algorithms in the Julia Programming Language. The course contains a lot of algorithms that are hard to hand-compute for large numbers, so writing them as a program can show how efficient they are with computers.

### This does not cover the entire 4-week program. There are some theorems and topics that are not implementable as code.
